# Refresh All Nodes

*Unreal Engine plugin that refreshes all blueprint nodes in every blueprint* 

## Installation

### Pre-compiled (recommended)

*Pre-compiled released of this plugin are supplied for Windows 64-bit.*

Download a release that matches your version of Unreal Engine [from here](https://github.com/nachomonkey/RefreshAllNodes/releases), and extract it into your project's Plugins directory.

Relaunch the editor.

### Compiling from source

Clone or [download](https://github.com/nachomonkey/RefreshAllNodes/releases/tag/v1.1) the repository into your project's Plugins directory and relaunch the editor.

A message should appear asking to compile the plugin.

## Usage

This plugin adds the **Refresh All Blueprint Nodes** button to the Blueprints toolbar menu as shown below:

Clicking the button will refresh all nodes in all blueprints. It performs the same action as manually using "Refresh All nodes" on each blueprint, and then optionally compiles the blueprint. After the blueprints have all been refreshed, they are saved.

The "Refresh Blueprints" action, found in the Content Browser's right-click context menu, will refresh blueprints found in the selected folders.

Note: Refreshing blueprint nodes may cause node breakages and change variable types if used in certain circumstances following a Hot Reload.


### Configuration

The plugin can be configured under **Project Settings ->  Plugins -> Refresh All Nodes**

![Configuration](docs/Configuration.png)

* Compile Blueprints: If checked, the plugin will compiled the blueprints after refreshing them. Enabling compilation will allow the plugin to catch  errors in the blueprints, but it will take more time to process.

* Refresh Level Blueprints: If checked, the plugin will search for level blueprints. This will cause the corresponding levels to be opened and saved, which can consume extra memory.
* Refresh Game Blueprints: If checked, the plugin will refresh blueprints found in the project's Content folder.
* Refresh Engine Blueprints: If checked, the plugin will refresh blueprints found in the engine's Content folder.
* Additional Blueprint Paths: Array of additional paths to search in. Most useful for plugins. Add the name of the plugin to refresh its blueprints.
* Exclude Blueprint Paths: Array of paths to not refresh blueprints in. Useful for excluding blueprints that are expensive to load.

## Limitations

This plugin's ability to refresh nodes is limited to Unreal Engine's built-in "Refresh All Nodes" function. The purpose of this plugin is only to provide an easy way to perform such action on Blueprint assets. This plugin is not responsible for any damage to Blueprints or any data loss.
